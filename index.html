        Aliens are super and only sometimes slimy. They don't smell bad like humans do and are closely related to earth felines. Aliens will not bite you like humans will but they can make you spontaneously combust so you should always be nice to them. If you are super nice to them they may even take you for a ride in their really cool rockets.
